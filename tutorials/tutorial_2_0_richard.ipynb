        "\n",
        "An SAE feature represents a pattern or concept that the autoencoder has learned to detect in the input data. These features often correspond to meaningful semantic, syntactic, or otherwise interpretable elements of text, and correspond to linear directions in activation space. SAEs are trained on the activations of a specific part of the model, and after training, these features show up as activations in the hidden layer of the SAE (which is much wider than the source activation vector, and produces one hidden activation per feature). As such, the hidden activations represent a decomposition of the entangled/superimposed features found in the original model activations. Ideally, these activations are sparse: Only a few of the many possible hidden activations actually activate for a given piece of input. This sparseness tends to correspond to ease of interpretability.\n",

        "The dashboard shown here provides a detailed view of a single SAE feature. (Refresh the cell to see more examples). Let's break down its components:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "2. Logit Plots: The top positive and negative logits for the feature. The values indicate the strength of the association.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Activations Density Plot: This histogram shows the distribution of activation values for this feature across a randomly sampled dataset. The x-axis represents activation strength, and the y-axis shows frequency. The top chart is simply the distribution of non-zero activations, and the second plot shows the density of negative and positive logits.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Test Activation: You can use this feature within the notebook or Neuronpedia itself--simply enter text to see how the feature is activated across the text.\n",
        "\n",

To do this, we find the maximum activation of a feature in a set of text (using the activation store above), use this as the default scale, multiple it by the vector representing the feature (as extracted from the decoder weights), and finally multiply this by a parameter that we control. This can be varied to see its effect on the text. Below, we'll try steering with a feature that often fires on religious or philosophical statements (feature [20115](https://www.neuronpedia.org/gpt2-small/7-res-jb/20115)).
